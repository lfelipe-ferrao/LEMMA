# Version 0.10.1
All threads used to decompress genotype columns. Major refactoring to prepapre for multi-phenos (eg. main and interaction effect parameters separated into separate objects).

# Version 0.9.1
Minor bugfix in hyps maxizing hyps.

# Version 0.9.0
Each run assigned to a single core. Think this is highly wasteful.
